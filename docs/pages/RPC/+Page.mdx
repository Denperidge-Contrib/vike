[Remote Procedure Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) (RPC, aka Server Actions) is a simple yet powerful technique to fetch data.

> RPC enables the frontend to seamlessly call backend functions, see in-depth explanation [here](https://telefunc.com/RPC).

> See <Link href="/data-fetching" /> for a general introduction about fetching data with Vike.

Common RPC tools:

- [Telefunc](https://telefunc.com)
  > Telefunc was created by the Vike team.

  > You'll soon be able to use Telefunc also to fetch initial data (instead of using the `data()` hook), see [Telefunc > #102](https://github.com/brillout/telefunc/issues/102).
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
  > Similar to Telefunc:
  >  - Con: Telefunc is simpler.
  >  - Pro: supports real-time data using websockets.
