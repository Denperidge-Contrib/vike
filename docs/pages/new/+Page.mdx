You can use [Bati](https://batijs.dev) to scaffold a new Vike app (that uses <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link>).

You can also, if you want full control over integration, use the following command to scaffold a new Vike app that doesn't use any Vike extension.

<Warning>
We recommend using the following command only if:
 - you are an expert user and you want control over integration code, or
 - you are curious.
</Warning>

With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```shell
npm init vike@latest
```

With [pnpm](https://pnpm.io):

```shell
pnpm create vike
```

With [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```shell
yarn create vike
```

Options:
