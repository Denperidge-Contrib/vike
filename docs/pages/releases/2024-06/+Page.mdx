## Improved Nested Layouts

Vike now has first-class support for nested layouts.

```yaml
pages/+Layout.js
pages/product/@id/+Layout.js
pages/product/@id/pricing/+Page.js
pages/product/@id/reviews/+Page.js
```

See <Link href="/Layout#nested-layout" />.

> Caching the data of the outer layout is work-in-progress, see [#1689 - [Nested Layouts] Cache data of outer layout](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1689).

Thank you [`@Blankeos`](https://github.com/Blankeos) for your contributions!

## `clientOnly()`

Vue users can now use the <Link href="/clientOnly">`clientOnly()`</Link> helper which is like`<ClientOnly>` wrapper (now depreacted) but with a much improved DX.

Solid users already had `clientOnly()` for a while now, and there is a feature request for `vike-react`: [#102 - `clientOnly()` instead of `<ClientOnly>`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-react/issues/102). Contribution welcome!

## Getting close to `1.0.0`

The three main reasons why we aren't releasing `1.0.0` are:

1. [x] Nested Layouts.
2. [ ] Using Vite to transpile server code.
3. [ ] A big announcement we'll unveil later this sommer.
   > It will be pivotal to the project. Stay tuned.

We're getting close to the [`1.0.0` release](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22v1+release+%3Astar2%3A%22).


## `bodyHtmlBegin`/`bodyHtmlEnd`

A common need with Vue is to insert the HTML of teleports. You can now do that with the following new settings:
- <Link href="/bodyHtmlBegin" />
- <Link href="/bodyHtmlEnd" />


## Roadmap

Major features we're working on:

- Vike CLI.
  > Replacing the Vite CLI which is an important structural change enabling a lot of upcoming features.
- Use Vite to transpile server code.
  > Including standalone server builds, and development directly against edge runtimes (e.g. Cloudflare's workerd). Led by [@nitedani](https://github.com/nitedani).
- Rehaul `vike.dev` aesthetics and UX. (New design is done and we'll implement it once we're finished with all `highest-priority` tickets.)
