## Flexible

Vike has been designed from the ground up to be flexible so that it can fit your needs.

### Architecture

With Vike you have architectural control, and you can choose any deployment strategy, any backend and data fetching setup, and any UI tool.

Use <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> for a quick start, and if an extension doesn't do what you need then you can eject and go for a custom integration instead. (We call this <Link href="/optional-control">Optional Control</Link>.)

Choose any tool, and integrate it however you want so that it fits your needs.

### Customizable

With Vike you can build your own framework with a bespoke architecture.

For example, you can build a company internal framework that embeds all your company best practices and tools.

Vike enables your highly technical/senior engineers to provide internal frameworks for your product-focused/junior engineers to ship as fast as never before.

### Less blockers

We focus on the long tail of details and features that unblock users. It's often the small details that decide whether you can achieve what you want.

A common source of blockers are bugs. That's why we systematically and quickly fix bugs &mdash; usually under 24 hours.


## Dependable

Vike is a highly dependable framework.

### Stable core

Vike is essentially a core that is extensible, robust, and stable.

This sturdy core enables stability as well as innovation. Building on top of Vike is a robust foundation enabling a diverse ecosystem and a wide range of <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link>.

Prominent extensions focus on dependability to support businesses in a stable and long-term fashion, while bleeding edge extensions focus on exploring the limits of what's possible in terms of performance and DX.

### Use new technologies at your own pace

Stop using a framework that forces you to use the bleeding edge. Use new technologies at your own pace and only if you see fit.

Vike's dual approach of having stable as well as cutting-edge extensions gives you choice.

### Minimize vendor lock-in

Choose tools, so that you aren't vender-locked into a specific tool or platform.

### Independent

Vike is an independent, transparent, and community-driven project that doesn't serve the special interests of a company. We serve the interests of our users.

Vike is made by engineers, for engineers.

## Quick start

We believe you can have both: a quick start as well as flexibility.

<Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> and [Bati](https://batijs.dev) provide a blazing fast start, without compromising on flexibility.
