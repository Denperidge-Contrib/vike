## Flexible

Vike has been designed from the ground up to be flexible so that it can fit your needs.

### Architecture

With Vike, you have architectural control and can choose any deployment strategy, any backend, any data-fetching method, and any UI tool.

Use <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> for a quick start, and if an extension doesn't do exactly what you need then eject it to customize it. Once ejected, you can go for fully custom integrations. We call this <Link href="/optional-control">Optional Control</Link>.

Choose any tool, while being able to control integrations to fit your needs.

### Less blockers

We focus on the long tail of details and features that unblock users. It's often the small details that decide whether you can achieve what you want.

A common source of blockers are bugs. That's why we systematically and quickly fix bugs &mdash; usually under 24 hours.

### Customizable

With Vike, you can build your own framework with a bespoke architecture.

For example, you can build a company internal framework that embeds all your company tools and best practices. This enables your highly-technical engineers to provide frameworks for your product-focused engineers to ship as fast as never before. It's a novel and powerful way to scale inside large organizations.


## Dependable

Vike is a dependable framework you can trust to build your business.

### Stable core

Vike is essentially a core that is extensible, robust, and stable.

This sturdy core enables stability as well as innovation. Building on top of Vike is a robust foundation enabling a diverse ecosystem of <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link>.

Prominent extensions focus on dependability to support businesses in a stable and long-term fashion, while bleeding edge extensions focus on exploring the limits of what's possible in terms of performance and DX.

### Use new technologies at your own pace

Stop using a framework that forces you to use the bleeding edge. Use new technologies at your own pace and only if you see fit.

Vike's dual approach of having stable as well as cutting-edge extensions gives you choice.

### Minimize vendor lock-in

With Vike, you have the freedom to choose your tools, your architecture, your deployment strategy.

Don't let a framework dictate what's best for you.

### By engineers, for engineers

Vike is a community-driven project that doesn't serve the special interests of a company. We serve the interests of our users.

By not relying on third-party interests, we are an independent voice to protect the interests of users.

Vike is made by engineers, for engineers.

## Quick start

We believe you can have both: a quick start as well as flexibility.

With <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> and [Bati](https://batijs.dev) you get started quickly, without compromising on flexibility.
