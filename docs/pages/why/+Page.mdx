## Flexible

Vike has been designed from the ground up to be flexible so that it can fit your needs.

### Architecture

With Vike, you have architectural control and can choose any deployment strategy, any backend, any data-fetching method, and any UI tool.

Use <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> for a quick start, and if an extension doesn't do exactly what you need then you can eject it to customize it. Once ejected, you can go for a fully custom integration. We call this <Link href="/optional-control">Optional Control</Link>.

Choose any tool, while being able to control integrations to fit your needs.

### Less blockers

Vike is flexible not only by design but also by prioritization: we focus on the long tail of details and features that unblock users. It's often the small details that decide whether you can achieve what you want.

A common source of blockers are bugs. That's why we [systematically and quickly fix bugs](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues?q=label%3A%22bug+%3Aboom%3A%22+) &mdash; usually under 24 hours.

> For example, with Vike, you have <Link href="/data#client-side">fine-grained control over where data is fetched</Link>: on the server-side, the client-side, or both.

> If you run into a blocker then don't hesitate to <Link href="/faq#i-ve-difficulties-integrating-a-tool-can-i-get-help">reach out</Link>. We want to know about blockers so we can resolve them.

### Customizable

With Vike, you can build your own framework with a bespoke architecture.

For example, you can build a company internal framework that embeds all your company tools and best practices. This enables your highly-technical engineers to provide frameworks for your product-focused engineers to ship as fast as never before. It's a novel and powerful way to scale inside large organizations.


## Dependable

Vike's architecture provides a uniquely robust foundation.

### Stable core

Vike, essentially, is a core that is extensible, robust, and stable.

This sturdy core both provides stability and enables innovation, fostering a diverse ecosystem of <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link>.

Prominent extensions focus on dependability to support businesses in a stable and long-term fashion, while cutting-edge extensions push the envelope on performance and DX.

### Use new technologies at your own pace

Stop using a framework that forces you to use the bleeding edge. Use new technologies at your own pace and only if you see fit.

Vike's dual approach of having stable as well as cutting-edge extensions gives you choice.

### Minimize vendor lock-in

With Vike, you have the freedom to choose your tools, your architecture, your deployment strategy.

Don't let a framework dictate what's best for you.

### By engineers, for engineers

Vike is a community-driven project 100% made by engineers and 100% independent from third-party interests.

We don't serve the interests of some unrelated business, we serve the interests of our users.

## Quick start

We believe you can have both: a quick start as well as flexibility.

With <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> and [Bati](https://batijs.dev) you get started quickly, without compromising on flexibility.
